- COIL: Coil ID, also referred to as 'Output Material', 'Product', or 'Production'.
- STCOD: Steel grade, which can be called 'Steel Grade', 'Coil Grade', 'Material Grade', or 'TDC Grade'.
- CTHICK: Coil thickness, which can also be called 'Output Material Thickness', 'Product Thickness', or 'Production Thickness'.

When handling dates, you should convert normal date formats (like "24 September 2024") into the SQL format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM".


Supported Operations:

Yield Calculation: Calculate yield as the ratio of AWEIT (coil weight) to S_WEIGHT (slab weight), rounded to 2 decimal places.
Quality Check: Count good or bad quality coils based on thickness and width tolerances.
Averages: Calculate averages for slab weights or other metrics based on shifts, day, or date range.
Sum & Count: Sum or count records based on shifts, steel grade, or date range.
List: Retrieve records filtered by coil, slab, or steel grade.
Shift-based Queries: Production statistics filtered by shifts A, B, or C.
    
Convert the following question into an SQL query:

{user_question}

Instructions:
- Use the **RESULT** table for all queries.
- Convert date formats like "24 September 2024" to 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'.
- For shifts: Shift A is 06:00:00 to 13:59:59, Shift B is 14:00:00 to 20:59:59, and Shift C is 21:00:00 to 05:59:59 (next day).
- If the question involves **Yield**, use the formula: Yield = AWEIT / S_WEIGHT.
- If the question involves quality, use the provided good or bad quality conditions.
- Ensure proper date filtering when relevant (e.g., for day or week queries).
- Provide counts, averages, or sums as requested.
- For any averages, round the result to 2 decimal places.     
- For good quality:
    - CTHICK is within +/- 0.013 of OTHICK.
    - CWIDTH is within +13 of OWIDTH.

For good quality:
    - CTHICK is within +/- 0.013 of OTHICK.
    - CWIDTH is within +13 of OWIDTH.

To find not good quality i.e bad quality coils or slabs, you can use the following SQL pattern:
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS BadQualityCount
    FROM RESULT
    WHERE 
    (ABS(CTHICK - OTHICK) > 0.013) OR 
    (CWIDTH < OWIDTH +- 13) 

To find  good quality coils or slabs, you can use the following SQL pattern:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS GoodQualityCount
FROM RESULT
WHERE 
   (ABS(CTHICK - OTHICK) > 0.013) OR 
    (CWIDTH < OWIDTH - 13 OR CWIDTH > OWIDTH + 13)


The following operations are supported:
- **Yield**: Calculate the ratio of output weight to input weight (Yield = aweit / s_weight).
- **Averages**: Calculate the average based on shift, day, week, month, or grade.
- **Sum**: Sum the data based on shift, day, week, month, or grade.
- **List**: Coil-wise or slab-wise list for shift, day, week, or month.
- **Average Shift Production**: Average number or weight of coils/slabs produced in a shift.

Provide a query to calculate the yield of coils or slabs for a specific steel grade, batch, or date.
 The yield is defined as the ratio of the actual weight (AWEIT) to the slab weight (S_WEIGHT), 
 and should be rounded to 2 decimal places give the result in percentage .

#### **Yield Calculation Formula**:
- Yield is calculated as: **Yield = (Output Weight / Input Weight)**, i.e. - AWEIT / S_WEIGHT.

example : Yield of a Specific Steel Code (STCOD): For the steel code E150Br, the yield calculation query would be:
  SQL:
    SELECT ROUND(SUM(AWEIT) / SUM(S_WEIGHT), 2) AS Yield
    FROM RESULT
    WHERE STCOD = 'E150Br';

Example: What is the yield on 3rd October 2024?
   SQL:
   SELECT ROUND(SUM(AWEIT) / SUM(S_WEIGHT)) AS Yield 
   FROM RESULT 
   WHERE DATEE BETWEEN '2024-10-03 00:00:00' AND '2024-10-03 23:59:59';

   Example: How many coils were produced in the last 2 days?
   SQL command :
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM RESULT WHERE DATEE BETWEEN datetime('now', '-2 days') AND datetime('now');

   
SHIFT - 
Generate SQL queries based on the following questions related to production shifts in a manufacturing context:

Count of Good Quality Coils:

"How many good quality coils were produced in Shift 'A'?"
"Count of good quality coils in Shift 'B'."
"Number of good quality coils in Shift 'C'."
Count of Bad Quality Coils:

"How many bad quality coils were produced in Shift 'A'?"
"Count of bad quality coils in Shift 'B'."
"Number of bad quality coils in Shift 'C'."
Average Slab Weight:

"What is the average slab weight produced in Shift 'A'?"
"Calculate the average slab weight for Shift 'B'."
"Average slab weight in Shift 'C'."

For counting good quality coils:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS GoodQualityCount
FROM RESULT
WHERE 
    (ABS(CTHICK - OTHICK) <= 0.013) 
    AND (CWIDTH >= OWIDTH - 13) 
    AND (CWIDTH <= OWIDTH + 13)
    AND SHIFT = 'YourShiftValue';

For counting bad quality coils:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS BadQualityCount
FROM RESULT
WHERE 
    (ABS(CTHICK - OTHICK) > 0.013) 
    OR (CWIDTH < OWIDTH - 13) 
    OR (CWIDTH > OWIDTH + 13)
    AND SHIFT = 'YourShiftValue';

For calculating average slab weight:

SELECT AVG(S_WEIGHT) AS AverageSlabWeight
FROM RESULT
WHERE SHIFT = 'YourShiftValue';



For example:
    Example 1 - How many coils were produced on 25 September 2024?
    The SQL command will be something like this: 
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM RESULT WHERE DATEE BETWEEN '25-09-2024 00:00' AND '25-09-2024 23:59';

    You can also detect the number of good quality coils with specific grades using queries like:
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM RESULT WHERE STCOD IN ('E250Br', 'E350Br') AND (ABS(CTHICK - OTHICK) <= 0.013 AND ABS(CWIDTH - OWIDTH) <= 13);

    For example:
    Example 1 - How many good quality coils with E250Br and E350Br?
    The SQL command will be something like this:
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM RESULT WHERE STCOD IN ('E250Br', 'E350Br') AND (ABS(CTHICK - OTHICK) <= 0.013 AND ABS(CWIDTH - OWIDTH) <= 13);

    **Example**: How many coils were produced in the last 2 days?
   SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM RESULT WHERE DATEE BETWEEN datetime('now', '-2 days') AND datetime('now');

   
For example:
1. **How many records are present?**
   SQL command: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM RESULT;

2. **Show all coils with steel grade 'E250Br'.**
   SQL command: SELECT * FROM RESULT WHERE STCOD='E250Br';

3. **List all products where the width is greater than 1200.**
   SQL command: SELECT * FROM RESULT WHERE CWIDTH > 1200;
